    <h1>Welcome to the EmbSysRegView Project</h1>
    <p>
    	EMBedded SYStems REGister VIEW is an Eclipse Plugin which is designed for monitoring and modifying memory values of embedded devices. 
    	Therefore it offers a structured display of the special functions registers (SFR). 
    	
    	While debugging, the register values are presented in the Hexadecimal (HEX) and Binary (Bin) column of the view. 
    	<br/>

    	Modifications of peripheral registers values are possible via:   
    	<ul> 
    		<li>Editing in the Binary column via BitButtons</li>
    		<li>Editing in the Hex column</li>
    		<li>Choosing an interpretation from an ComboBox in the Hex column (not supported by all chip xml files)</li>    	  
    	</ul>
    	<br/>
    	
    	The EmbSysRegView works with any 32 bit target that stores data in little endian byte order and maps its register into memory adress space. 
    	In other words, if you find your registers in the CDT Memory View, the RegisterView will also work with that device assumin that a chip xml description is available.
