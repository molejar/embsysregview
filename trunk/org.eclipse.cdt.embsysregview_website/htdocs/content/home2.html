    <h1>Known Problems</h1>
    <p> <h2>Eclipse >=3.6</h2>
    	 in my investigation i found out that when you use eclipse >=3.6.x you are using CDT >=7.x. i guess you are using the "C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging" component of CDT for debugging your device. CDT 7.x comes with a new interface (DSF-GDB) to GDB that is enabled by default. You have to switch to the old CDI/MI interface instead of the new in CDT 7.0. You can do this in the Debug Configuration under GDB Hardware Debugging -> Your Configuration -> Main Tab-> on the bottom "Using GDB (DSF) Hardware Debugging Launcher" - Select other... Click on "Select other..." and select "Standard GDB Hardware Debugging Launcher" The View is not prepared for the new interface and therefore get no notification about suspend events, therfore cannot update the registers when it sould have.
