    <h1>Known Problems</h1>
    <p> <h2>Eclipse >=3.6</h2>
    	 If you use eclipse >=3.6.x you are using CDT 7.x that comes with a new interface (DSF-GDB) to GDB that is enabled by default. You have to switch to the old CDI/MI interface instead of the new in CDT 7.0. You can do this in the Debug Configuration under GDB Hardware Debugging -> Your Configuration -> Main Tab-> on the bottom "Using GDB (DSF) Hardware Debugging Launcher" - Select other... Click on "Select other..." and select "Standard GDB Hardware Debugging Launcher".
