+ ... Done   - ... dismissed   * ... TODO

bugfixing:
==========
*) get MISession on view open if debug is already active
   *  currently miSession is only updated when debug event received (next debug step after view open)

*) ERROR: org.eclipse.cdt.debug.mi.core.cdi.MI2CDIException: Target is not suspended[]

*) TODO: update all registers ...if the edited Register affects others
   + update all activated fields if changed field is WriteOnly

enhancements:
=============
*) Project specific settings vs. Workspace settings
   * on a project basis would mean the view has to switch 
     to the other chip on the fly if you select the other project 
     (and remember all the opened/selected registers).
     
*) Merge shipped xml with xml in home dir
   * to extend existing xml
   * to correct xml
   * even to write xml that way
   
   1) only shipped xml -> simple load
   2) only home xml -> simple load
   3) shipped and home xml -> load shipped & insert home tags into dom
   
   xml chooser has to search shipped & home dir
   
*) add optional tag for xml open nameddest
   * doc.pdf#nameddest=Chapter6
   * where to find pdf (its too big for download on klick)
   
*) editing support
   * new dialog ...
   * right klick popupmenu->add group/registergroup/register/field
     /* MenuManager menuManager = new MenuManager();
        menuManager.add(new Separator(IWorkbenchActionConstants.MB_ADDITIONS));
        viewer.getTree().setMenu(menuManager.createContextMenu(viewer.getTree()));
        getSite().registerContextMenu(menuManager, viewer);*/
      * adds to bottom of list
      * (rearange via drag & drop -> complex & requires separate edit mode)
   * possibility to send in created files (direct/link/mail)
